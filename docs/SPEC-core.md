# SPEC-core: Project Philosophy

**Madoodle** is a high-craft, mobile-first interactive storybook platform designed to bring digital stories to life with the tangible warmth of physical books and the dynamic magic of the web.

## 🌟 Core Philosophy

### 1. "Digital Warmth"
We reject cold, sterile interfaces. Our app feels "alive" and "organic".
- **Textures & Layers**: Use subtle noise, paper textures, and depth.
- **Organic Motion**: Physics-based springs (not linear tweens) for everything.
- **Roundness**: Soft corners, concentric radii, friendly shapes.

### 2. "Expressive Text"
Text is not just static glyphs; it is an actor in the story.
- **The DSL**: Our custom markup language (`[style motion="bounce"]`) allows authors to imbue words with emotion.
- **Typography**: Curated font stack (Google Fonts) that reinforces the mood (Calm, Tense, Joyful).

### 3. "Immersive Audio"
Sound is a first-class citizen, not an afterthought.
- **Foley & Ambience**: Background loops (rain, cafe noise) that cross-fade smoothly.
- **Interaction Sounds**: Subtle "pop", "swish", "click" sounds on UI interactions.
- **Narration**: Word-level timing (future goal) and high-quality voiceovers.
